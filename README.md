## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matteo and I'm freelance software developer from Italy. <br>
Actually I'm focusing almost on frontend. In my main job I'm using two of the most popular frameworks in this field: Angular and React (with Next.js). <br>
Recently I had the chance to work on an MVP for a new company as fullstack developer using Node.js. <br>

On my Github I'll share side-projects and exercises. The latter are small repositories I use to try new things or fully understand concepts I'm studying.<br>

You can find me on:
