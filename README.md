## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matteo. 

I've worked as a freelancer for almost 2 years.
During this time I've got the chance to work on multiple digital products aimed at business and consumers, covering a variety of different domains.
Main collaborations were with <a href="https://www.fuoricitta.it/">FuoricittÃ </a> and <a href="https://hipsterstudio.it/">Hipster Studio</a>.
Actually I'm front-end developer at <a href="https://www.conio.com/">Conio Inc.</a>
